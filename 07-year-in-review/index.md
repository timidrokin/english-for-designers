# Year in review

What i learned..

## Github

I have never worked on this website before and I haven't seen it anywhere much. I am glad that I could try this on subject even though I learned some basics and maybe I will use them somewhere in the future.

## Presentation

Overall, speaking more in English through presentations has benefited me quite a bit. I felt more confident and my vocabulary improved a bit.


I will end by saying that this style of learning and the overall approach individually to each student was quite beneficial. I also learned many other things, such as how to use my speech or how to properly present my projects.
