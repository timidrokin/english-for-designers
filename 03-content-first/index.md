but just call me Timi and i'm a product photographer. I try to put a lot of colors into my photos and I look for interesting details. Outside of photography, I played ice hockey at a professional level for 16 years, also I would describe myself as very spontaneous guy and this is where my other hobby come from. Travelling. I try to develop in all possible directions and experiment a lot and try basically everything in photography.

# What i do...

## Portraits

One of the first genres I photographed were portraits. Mostly it's like that my friends or people from my circle write to me if I want to take a picture of them and I always say yes let's do it. I like the fact that when you go to take pictures with someone, you have a small conversation, you get to know a new person. I use different types of light and different colors in portraits.

## Analog

In 2015 I bought my first analog camera and since that year I have been more interested in analog and old photography. What I like about analog is that you take 36 photos, and when you digitize, you no longer remember what you took. And it's a magical feeling when you remember some small memories. This made me fall in love with the retro style and everything about retro.

## Collages

In my free time I do experiments with my photos and these projects are very personal to me. I try to express my feelings in them, some obstacles that I have overcome. Always at the end I always draw a smiley face there, which I use as my logo. It gives a slightly positive view.
