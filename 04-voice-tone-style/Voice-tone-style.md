### Voice, Tone and Style

## Voice

* quite - When I'm talking to someone about a subject that is not so close to me I tend to speak more quietly and at the same time very insecure.
* funny - During some conversations, especially among my friends, I often use my iconic funny language. I have a kind of humor that is versatile and lightens the conversation.
* calm - A lot of people tell me I have a pretty calm voice and they like to listen to that. It's probably related to my sounding empathetic and calm.

## Tone
I'm pretty comfortable with a lot of people I meet. I'm trying to be open to people and get to know them more, but again, I need to feel like they're giving me that energy back. 

* understanding - I'm pretty understanding and listening on a variety of topics.
* supporting - A lot of people come to me just to talk.
* empathetic - I modulate my voice according to how the listener feels.

## Style

Most of the time I try to be both funny and pretty straightforward. A lot of people I talk to appreciate those two qualities in conversations. Sometimes this is a bad trait, as some people don't appreciate my directness and honesty and sometimes take it offensively. On the other hand, they appreciate my humor in different sentences as I lighten up the conversation a lot.
