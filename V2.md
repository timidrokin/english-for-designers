## WORD MAYBE


When we think about the word maybe, it probably gives you a feeling of insecurity. And yes, it's a word I don't like very much.


I ask person a question -Do you have time tomorrow, can we meet?- and answer is maybe. Maybe what?


            If you have plans for tomorrow or things you need to do, you can say it. It's ok. I'd rather count on the fact that we won't meet tomorrow than hope that we might see each other. Yes, I understand, plans can change and maybe there will be time and we can meet. But in 90% of the time when i get this answer, I already set in my head that the event it won't happen. Why is that so? Because of that, I can't make my plans, schedule my day because WE MIGHT see each other.


            And I wouldn't even mind if the word used normally these days. It's such a general word for me. If the word was only used in situations where you really don't know, it would be fine. But I hear that word very often. You can -hey I can't today or hey I have something today.- It can be said, but people just don't want to say it and it's easier for them to say maybe.


The word gives me a feeling of insecurity, and maybe fear towards a person. Maybe the person who answers you like that doesn't want to hurt you in some way?


Of course, i also use this word, but i try use it less this and tell a person straight that i can't today or I have plans for today.
